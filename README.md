# Proyecto F1 Info
F1 Info is a website built with ReactJS, NodeJs and Express. It shows data from the history of F1, you can see all the drivers that have raced in F1, all the constructors, all the circuits, all the seasons and the results of each race.

## Tech

F1 Info uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [ReactJs]
- [Create React App]
- [Bootsrap]
- [React-Bootsrap]
- [NodeJs]
- [Express]
- [Sequelize]
- [Ergast Developer Api]


## Installation

F1 Info requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.

Install the dependencies and start the server.

Clone the repository in your desktop or download the project.
Open the Git Bash

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JoseAl05/F1-Info-Project.git
cd F1-Info-Project
npm i
```
Now run the server:
```sh
cd backend/f1-info
nodemon app
(If you don't want to install nodemon dependency)
node app
```
Go back to the main folder to run the client server:
```sh
cd f1-info
npm start
```
